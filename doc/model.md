# Model - Sim Template

This document describes the model (the underlying physics, math, and behavior) for the simulation, in
terms appropriate for an educator. It is the companion to
[implementation-notes.md](./implementation-notes.md), which targets developers. Replace the placeholder
content below with a description of your own sim's model when you fork this template.

## Overview

*One or two paragraphs describing what the simulation models and the key ideas a student should take
away. Write for a teacher, not a programmer — avoid code and class names.*

The template ships with no domain-specific physics; it is a minimal Model-View scaffold. A real sim
replaces this section with its actual conceptual model.

## Quantities and units

*List the primary modeled quantities, their symbols, units (SI where applicable), and ranges.*

| Quantity | Symbol | Units | Range |
|---|---|---|---|
| *(example)* time | t | s | 0 – ∞ |

## Governing equations

*State the equations or rules that drive the model, with a sentence explaining each. Use a smaller
fixed time step than the screen default if the integration requires it; the model makes no assumption
about frame rate.*

## Simplifications and assumptions

*Note anything intentionally idealized or omitted relative to the real-world phenomenon (e.g. no air
resistance, point masses, instantaneous response), so educators can set expectations.*

## References

*Optional: textbook sections, papers, or standards the model is based on.*
